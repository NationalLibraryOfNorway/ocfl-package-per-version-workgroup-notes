# OCFL Package Per Version Workgroup Notes
Repository for notes, ideas, etc, from the the workgroup dedicated to introducing package per version model into OCFL specification.

* [File Formats](format-questions.md)
* [Single VS Multipart containers questions](single-vs-multipart-containers-questions.md)

## Proposal
* [Low Impact](proposal-low-impact.md)
* [Medium Impact](proposal-medium-impact.md)

## Motivation
[The Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL)](https://github.com/OCFL/spec "OCFL spec repository on GitHub") offers a good way of organizing files with focus on versioning.
However some people are interested in the use case where they can package contents of the version folders.
This has been discussed in [Use-Case 33](https://github.com/OCFL/Use-Cases/issues/33 "Discussion surrounding 'Package per version storage' use-case").
To further discuss and develop this idea this working group has been formed as we attempt to create a suggestion for how to define this use-case in the specification.
